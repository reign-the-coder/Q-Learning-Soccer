### Python
I use Python3 with packages numpy, matplotlib, and cvxopt.

### How to Run
For whatever algorithm you want to get information on, do `python3 <file>` such as `python3 Foe-Q.py`. There is a file for each algorithm. Graphs will be outputted as <file>.png these graphs are the differences between Q values at the initial state. So running Foe-Q would produce Foe-Q.png. For safe keeping the images in the report are in `final_images`. Options for algorithm include Q.py, Foe-Q.py, Friend-Q.py, and CEQ.py  
  
Changing variables like how many episodes or the alpha start requires to modify the code itself.
